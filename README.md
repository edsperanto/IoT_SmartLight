# IoT SmartLight

## Summary

This was an IoT project for Circuits I class. We had to develop something that controlled a circuitry via a Raspberry Pi via the internet. I worked on this project with Sara Marcjan, who provided the miniature house, and wired it up with LEDs and an electromagnet, which was then controlled from the internet via a Raspberry Pi 3.
